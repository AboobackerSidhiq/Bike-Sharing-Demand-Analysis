Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bike rental trends to uncover patterns in usage based on weather, season, and time of day. This project uses Python for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights to optimize bike-sharing services.

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook (`Final Project.ipynb`) analyzes a bike rental dataset to answer key questions:
- How do **weather conditions** affect rental demand?
- What are peak **usage hours/days**?
- How does **seasonality** impact rentals?
- Differences between **casual vs. registered** users.

---

## 📂 **Dataset**
The dataset includes:
- **Temporal features:** Date, hour, weekday, month, year.
- **Weather features:** Temperature, humidity, windspeed, weather situation.
- **Usage metrics:** Count of casual vs. registered users, total rentals (`cnt`).

## 🛠️ **Tools & Libraries**
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** (Data cleaning/analysis)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive analysis)

## 🔍 **Key Insights**
1. **Peak Hours:** Rentals spike during commute times (8 AM and 5 PM).
2. **Weather Impact:** Clear days see 2x more rentals than rainy days.
3. **Seasonal Trends:** Highest demand in fall, lowest in winter.
4. **User Types:** Registered users dominate weekday rentals; casual users peak on weekends.
